###### How to use the HashTest ######

HashTest takes a list of plaintexts, generate the hashes and compare
them against a list with "check" hashes stored in "check_lists/".

At first you have to generate a set of lists with list_generator.py passing
a file with plaintexts. After that start HashTest with the Plaintext File you used. 
There is a sample file in the check_lists/ directory.


##### Quick #####

1. ./list_generator.py plain_1-28_100k_words.txt
2. ./HashTest check_lists/plain_1-28_100k_words.txt


##### Dependencies #####

list_generator.py needs serveral cryptolibs:

	- Passlib (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/passlib)
	- py-smbpasswd (http://barryp.org/software/py-smbpasswd/)
