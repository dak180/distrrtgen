Windows users
Extract the binary archive to a directory and setup is complete.

If you wish to build from source you can either use VC++ or MSYS/mingw.  You will need both openssl and pthreads includes and libraries.

*nix users
All systems will need the includes and libraries for openssl and pthreads.  Depending upon your system and package manager they will be named something similar to libssl-dev and libc6-dev.

Runtime performance is best when built using gcc 4.4.x or 4.5.x.

Linux users
run make and you should be finished

*BSD users
You must use gmake instead of make at the current time.

Mac OSX users
Depending upon your version and installed dev tools make may be sufficient but if it fails then run gmake.

Linux binary builds/packages
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=rcracki&project=home%3Aquelrod is the head/trunk build and you may look for derived packages named similar to the release names.
